# Interop Team Charter

The Interop Team aims to make the web more interoperable in key areas, prioritized by web developer and user needs. This team is part of [the web-platform-tests project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt), the main test suite for the web platform.

## Governance

The team makes decisions based on consensus. A decision has consensus if it has support from at least two participating organizations and no opposition.

The team operates in public, except when otherwise allowed by this charter.

The team must publish a process document to define how it will develop a given metric. These process documents are adopted by a decision of the team. These process documents may define parts of their operation to be confidential to the team.

The chair of the team is responsible for organizing meetings, driving discussions to a conclusion, and recording decisions. The team appoints an individual as the chair based on consensus at a minimum once per calendar year. The term limit for the chair will be 1 year and the same individual can be reappointed as chair, if there is consensus. If the team is unable to meet due to absence of a chair, the Core Team may appoint one directly.

Meeting time and agenda should be announced by the chair at least 48 hours in advance, and meeting minutes posted in the repository.

The Interop Team's work is subject to the [WPT code of conduct](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All contributions are licensed under the terms in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Substantive changes to this charter are done via the [web-platform-tests RFC process](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs). Substantive changes to this charter can be made using the wpt RFC process, with an additional requirement of explicit consensus from the Interop Team participants.

## Scope

The Interop Team's scope includes metrics designed to measure and improve the interoperability of the web platform. These metrics are published once consensus to do so has been reached.

These metrics are expected to be comprised of:

- Groups of automated tests that can be used to automatically compute an interoperability score for specific platform features in implementations.
- Work to improve the interoperability of the platform that cannot be measured through test pass rates and is scored by consensus decision.

The team is responsible for maintaining [Interop 2021](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2021), [2022](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022), [2023](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023), and defining future interoperability efforts and metrics.

If the team is unable reach consensus to publish any new metrics, and has been unable to reach consensus for three months, the team's functions revert to the Core Team and this charter is annulled.

### Out of Scope

This is not a venue for standardization work. Further, the team will avoid creating metrics which depend on significant standards work. However, this does not preclude the team from liaising with existing standards groups to help progress work which affects the interoperability of the platform, or the ability to test and measure interoperability of existing features (including features whose specification is determined to be ready-for-implementation but where there is yet to be any implementation).

Browser features that don't affect web developers, like bookmarks, are out of scope.

## Team Members

The following organizations make up the Interop Team, in alphabetical order:

* Apple
* Bocoup
* Google
* Igalia
* Microsoft
* Mozilla

## Joining and Leaving the Team

The Interop Team is made up of organizations with a track record of contributions to the web-platform-tests project.

Organizations may apply to join the team by contacting the chair. New members will be added with a consensus decision of existing members. The deliberations are confidential to the existing members.

Existing members may leave the team at any time without further obligation.
